<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Mary Joy B. Pe√±ero, I graduated on july 28, 2023 from Dr. Filemon C. Aguilar Memorial College IT - Campus 
  with a Bachelor`s in information system. I had an internship as a Web developer at one of reputable law firm for 3 months. 
  I was assigned to develop an easy-to-access and user-friendly website. It's more about giving the clients information 
  about their firm, such as their history, services, location, contacts, practices, etc.  I enjoy taking on new challenges, 
  I pick things up quickly, and I work hard to develop my ability to swiftly adjust to different situations.  My goal is to 
  land a great job that will allow me to use my knowledge and abilities to significantly contribute to the team and, hopefully,
   improve my career.
